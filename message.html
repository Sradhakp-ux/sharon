        In all my life, I've never met anyone like you. I didn't choose you randomly. I chose you because I truly understand you after all these years. No matter what happens, I never want to lose you. We've been through so many emotions, but through it all, I know one thing for sure: We need this relationship. We need to stand by each other. Having you around makes me the happiest and luckiest even if you don't always realize it. So whenever you're feeling down or unsure, please read this and remember how much you mean to me.
